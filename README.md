## Exercise 1 [(Help)](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)

For this Exercise we will need a little software called Insomnia/Postman (or any other HTTP client), it will allow us to test our URLs.

We now want that when the user sends a PUT request to the home (http://localhost:5000/) it sends back an HTML file with :

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Hello</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    How are you?
  </body>
</html>
```

## Exercise 3 [(Help)](http://expressjs.com/fr/4x/api.html#res.json)

We now want that when the user sends a DELETE request to the home (http://localhost:5000/) it sends back a JSON with:
